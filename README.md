## App Summary:
**For Hikers who love keeping track of the State/National parks theyve visited, the Hiking App is a National/State Park Community site that will allow hikers to track the parks they have visited /want to visit and engage with other park enthusiasts. Unlike other hiking sites, this will serve as a central location to track and plan your hiking achievements and use the community of hikers to help you and others achieve your National/State Park hiking and camping goals**
